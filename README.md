# CodeClauseInternship_AlarmClock
I have created a simple alarm application using Tkinter by simple python.
Here users can set alarm and activate or deactivate it as per the requirement. Also i have used the concept of thread, 
as i want my alarm clock to run in background until the specified time is reached.
